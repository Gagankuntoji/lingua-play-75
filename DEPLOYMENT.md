## 📋 Pre-Deployment Checklist

- [ ] Environment variables are configured in your deployment platform
- [ ] Supabase project is set up and migrations are applied
- [ ] Row-level security policies are configured in Supabase
- [ ] Production build works locally (`npm run build`)
- [ ] All API keys are added to environment variables (never commit them!)

---

## 🔧 Environment Variables

Make sure to add these in your deployment platform:

| Variable | Description | Required |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` | Your Supabase project URL | ✅ Yes |
| `VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` | Supabase anon/public key | ✅ Yes |
| `VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY` | OpenAI API key for ChatGPT | ❌ Optional |

---

## 🧪 Testing the Build Locally

Before deploying, test your production build:

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

Visit `http://localhost:4173` to preview the production build.

---

## 🔄 Continuous Deployment

Both Vercel and Netlify automatically deploy when you push to your main branch. Just commit and push:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Deploy updates"
git push origin main
```

---

## 🌐 Custom Domain

### Vercel:
1. Go to Project Settings → Domains
2. Add your custom domain
3. Follow DNS configuration instructions

### Netlify:
1. Go to Site settings → Domain management
2. Add custom domain
3. Configure DNS as instructed

---

## 📝 Notes

- The `vercel.json` and `netlify.toml` files are already configured
- Your app uses client-side routing (React Router), so all routes redirect to `index.html`
- Environment variables starting with `VITE_` are exposed to the client
- Never commit `.env` files with real keys to GitHub

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

**Build fails:**
- Check that all dependencies are in `package.json`
- Verify Node.js version (requires ≥18)
- Check build logs in your deployment platform

**Environment variables not working:**
- Ensure they're set in your deployment platform's settings
- Restart/redeploy after adding variables
- Check variable names match exactly (case-sensitive)

**404 errors on routes:**
- Verify redirect rules are configured (already in `vercel.json` and `netlify.toml`)
- Check that `index.html` is in the root of the build output

Happy deploying! 🎉
